# Day 14: Module 1 Challenge
**Completion Date:** 14 Jun 2019

**Learned:** 
equality testing for variable type (just "== int", "== str", etc)

# Day 15: Dictionaries
**Completion Date:** 17 Jun 2019

**Learned:**
one key can have a list of values that can be retrieved by slicing
can add keys in any order
comparing dictionaries
accessing list of keys and values
accessing key in a tuple, accessing values by tuple slicing or lookup by key

# Day 16: Sets
**Completion Date:** 17 Jun 2019

**Learned:**
creating sets with {} or keyword "sets"
mutable and iterable
determining the different or overlapping elements
.difference_update(<other set>) removes elements that are already in other set with no output, changes the set
.symmetric_difference(<other set>) returns elements unique to one of the sets, does not change the set
.symmetric_difference_update(<other set>) does the same but changes the set
sorting, removing, discarding (remove throws error, discard does not), use try and except for "remove"
frozenSet cannot be modified, immutable
.clear() to empty the set

interacting with filesystem
installing extra packages with pip

# Day 19: File Input/Output

docstrings and .__doc__ object
typestrings for autocomplete hints and docstring details

# Day 21: Pytest
**Completion Date:** 21 Jun 2019

**Learned:** 
setting up configuration to run pytests

# Day 22: Recursive Functions
**Completion Date:** 28 Jun 2019

**Learned:** 
Fibonacci of 20000 is a very very long number
Was able to execute higher than the recursion limit on cached recursion but not regular recursion

# Day 23: Lambdas
**Completion Date:** 28 Jun 2019

**Learned:** 
getting into the habit of writing with few lines makes you a more efficient and creative Python problem solver
lambda is simpler and shorter but more limited in functionality than regular functions - multiway comparisons, docstrings, etc

# Day 24: Object Oriented Python
**Completion Date:** 28 Jun 2019

**Learned:** 
Python pillars are app development, data science, and web development - OOP falls under app development
Decorators "wrap" functions - can pass a function as a param to another function, extends the behavior of the higher up function w/o changing it
Inner functions are defined inside other functions, if they are defined by another variable they can be accessed
Decorators can be over-complicated, but classes help keep code simple and have more functionality than tuples and dictionaries
